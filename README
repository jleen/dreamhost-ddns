# Synology Dynamic DNS for DreamHost Users #

If your Synology NAS doesn't have a static IP address, it can be a pain to access.
If you have a DreamHost-managed domain (e.g. `theskyisovercast.com`), you can solve this problem
by making a subdomain for your Synology NAS (e.g. `cloudlet.theskyisovercast.com`).
Follow these directions to install a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) provider for your Synology NAS
that will show up in its Control Panel and manage (create or update)
a subdomain of a DreamHost-managed domain whenever its IP address changes.

 1. Install the Python 2.x package on your Synology NAS.
 
 2. Synology's Python `_ssl` (and MacPorts Python) has a problem connecting to "http://api.dreamhost.com".
    The workaround is to install and use the package `tlslite`:
    1. Install `pip`. Here is the easiest way to do this:
        
        `# curl -k https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python`

    2. Install `tlslite`:
        
        `# pip install tlslite`

 3. Save `dreamhostddns` to `/usr/local/bin/`

 4. Generate an API key from: https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.api for "All dns functions".

 5. Edit `/etc.defaults/ddns_provider.conf` (make a copy first to be safe) and add these lines at the bottom:

    ```
    [DreamHost]
            modulepath=/usr/local/bin/dreamhostddns
            queryurl=ignored
    ```
    
    NOTE: You must edit `/etc.defaults/ddns_provider.conf`, not `/etc/ddns_provider.conf` (which doesn't exist).

 6. Open the DDNS Control Panel and set Hostname to your desired hostname (e.g. `cloudlet.mydomain.com`) and Password to the API key you generated.
    Username/Email is ignored; set it to anything.

NOTE: DreamHost DNS entries have a TTL (time-to-live) of 4 hours so they
won't be quite as dynamic as a real DynDNS service.
