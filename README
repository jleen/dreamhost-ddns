Synology Dynamic DNS for DreamHost Users

It's simple to use DreamHost as the Dynamic DNS for your Synology NAS.

 * Install the Python 2.x package on your Synology NAS.
 
 * UPDATE: Synology's Python _ssl (and MacPorts Python) has a problem connecting to "http://api.dreamhost.com".
   The workaround is to install and use the package "tlslite":
    1. Install pip. The easiest way to do this:
        
        `# curl -k https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | python`

    2. Install tlslite:
        
        `# pip install tlslite`

 * Save "dreamhostddns" to /usr/local/bin/

 * Get an API key from: https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.api for "All dns functions".

 * Edit /etc/ddns_provider.conf and add the lines:

    ```
    [DreamHost]
            modulepath=/usr/local/bin/dreamhostddns
            queryurl=ignored
            register_module=dreamhost
    ```

 * Open the DDNS panel and set your password to your API key and your desired hostname.
   Your username is ignored.

NOTE: DreamHost DNS entries have a TTL (time-to-live) of 4 hours so they
won't be quite as dynamic as a real DynDNS service.
