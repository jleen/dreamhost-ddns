Synology Dynamic DNS for DreamHost Users

It's simple to use DreamHost as the Dynamic DNS for your Synology NAS.

 * Install the Python 2.x package on your Synology NAS.

 * Save "dreamhostddns" to /usr/local/bin/

 * Get an API key from: https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.api
   for "All dns functions".

 * Edit /etc/ddns_provider.conf and add the lines:
[DreamHost]
        modulepath=/usr/local/bin/dreamhostddns
        queryurl=ignored
        register_module=dreamhost

 * Open the DDNS panel and set your password to your API key and your desired hostname.
   Your username is ignored.

NOTE: DreamHost DNS entries have a TTL (time-to-live) of 4 hours so they
won't be quite as dynamic as a real DynDNS service.
